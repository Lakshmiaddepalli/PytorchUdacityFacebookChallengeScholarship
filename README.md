# Pytorch Udacity Facebook Challenge Scholarship

Together with Udacity, Facebook is investing in a scholarship program that will enable students to acquire cutting-edge skills in deep learning using Pytorch, a popular, fast-growing open-source deep learning framework that provides a seamless path from AI research to production deployment. The program makes available 10,000 seats for a Challenge Course, which is “Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch.” 300 students will go on to earn full scholarships for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program.
